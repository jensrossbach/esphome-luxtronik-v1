# Contributing to ESPHome Luxtronik V1
Welcome to the contribution guide of ESPHome Luxtronik V1. There are many ways to contribute like reporting bugs, proposing new features or providing feedback.

## üêû Reporting Problems
If you encountered a bug or other problem, you are welcome to create a **Problem Report** in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jensrossbach/esphome-luxtronik-v1/issues). Before creating the issue, please check if the problem has already been reported by someone else. If so, instead of entering a duplicate issue, please add a comment to the existing issue telling about the details of your problem (the more precise the problem reports are, the better they can be distinguished from each other in order to identify duplicates).

Please do not collect multiple problems in one issue, but instead enter one issue per problem. Try to be as precise as possible with your problem description. It is always helpful if you provide logs on debug level or higher. Refer to the ESPHome documentation of the [logger component](https://www.esphome.io/components/logger.html) if you do not know how to create logs and how to configure the log level. You can record logs from the command line using the following command:

```
esphome logs <your_config.yaml>
```

It could also be helpful to provide the YAML configuration of your ESPHome firmware. But don't forget to remove any privacy and security related data (e.g., passwords) or make use of `secrets.yaml` before uploading the file.

Please always use the Problem Report template in the issue tracker as it provides some prefilled hints about which information you should provide in your report.
